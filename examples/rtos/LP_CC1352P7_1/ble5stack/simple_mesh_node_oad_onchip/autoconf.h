@brief This file contains the definitions required for the Zephyr Mesh Profile
       to operate successfully.

       Please Note:
       All definitions in this file affect the Zephyr source files and the
       Mesh porting layer alone! Any BLE specific definitions in this file
       relate to the "Zephyr-side" and not the "TI-side".

Group: WCS, BTS
Target Device: cc13xx_cc26xx

/* This value defines in seconds how soon the RPL gets written to persistent
 * storage after a change occurs. If the node receives messages frequently it
 * may make sense to have this set to a large value, whereas if the RPL gets
 * updated infrequently a value as low as 0 (write immediately) may make sense.
 * Note that if the node operates a security sensitive use case, and there’s a
 * risk of sudden power loss, it may be a security vulnerability to set this
 * value to anything else than 0 (a power loss before writing to storage
 * exposes the node to potential message replay attacks). */
#define CONFIG_BT_MESH_RPL_STORE_TIMEOUT 5

/* This value defines how often the local sequence number gets updated in
 * persistent storage (i.e. flash). E.g. a value of 100 means that the sequence
 * number will be stored to flash on every 100th increment. If the node sends
 * messages very frequently a higher value makes more sense, whereas if the
 * node sends infrequently a value as low as 0 (update storage for every
 * increment) can make sense. When the stack gets initialized it will add this
 * number to the last stored one, so that it starts off with a value that’s
 * guaranteed to be larger than the last one used before power off. */

/* When the IV Update state enters Normal operation or IV Update in Progress,
 * we need to keep track of how many hours has passed in the state, since the
 * specification requires us to remain in the state at least for 96 hours
 * (Update in Progress has an additional upper limit of 144 hours).
 * In order to fulfill the above requirement, even if the node might be powered
 * off once in a while, we need to store persistently how many hours the node
 * has been in the state. This doesn’t necessarily need to happen every hour
 * (thanks to the flexible duration range). The exact cadence will depend a lot
 * on the ways that the node will be used and what kind of power source it has.
 * Since there is no single optimal answer, this configuration option allows
 * specifying a divider, i.e. how many intervals the 96 hour minimum gets split
 * into. After each interval the duration that the node has been in the current
 * state gets stored to flash. E.g. the default value of 4 means that the state
 * is saved every 24 hours (96 / 4). */
